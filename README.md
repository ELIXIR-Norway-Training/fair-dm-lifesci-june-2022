# FAIR Data Management in Life Sciences - 2022 Course, 1st Edition by ELIXIR Norway

## 14.-16. June, Virtual 

### About

The course aims to cover topics covering the whole data life cycle (as shown in the [Research Data Management kit by ELIXIR Europe](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)) with a specific focus on the implementation of [the FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The goal is to teach the key concepts on how to make life sciences data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for your research management.

### Learning Objectives

- To walk through data life cycle steps with an introduction to tools relevant to life sciences research, including in a context of computational analysis for life sciences.
- To understand FAIR principles in the context of each data cycle step
- To understand the data curation processes that enable data reuse and repurposing
- To know the different RDM guidelines and practices used by the various RIs and institutions in Norway. 

### Learning Outcomes:

- To be able to define and connect RDM tasks within a domain of interest.
- To be able to determine different tools that are available, globally and in Norway, to carry out RDM tasks.  
- To be able to identify metadata standards and to associate relevant deposition repositories
- To be able to analyse and evaluate FAIRness of Data (and Management Plan)

### Learning Activities:

Each session will include time for a short discussion including questions and answers. We plan to have a group activity on last day of the course that will involve reviewing and discussing how to create a FAIR DMP. In addition, we plan to include a short quiz relevant to each session; learners are recommended to take a quiz during or after the course to help revise and understand the content learned throughout the course.

### üë• Target Audience
