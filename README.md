## About

The course aims to cover topics covering the whole data life cycle (as shown in the [Research Data Management kit by ELIXIR Europe](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)) with a specific focus on the implementation of [the FAIR data principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/). The goal is to teach the key concepts on how to make life sciences data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable for your research management. The target audience is current and future life scientists in Norway.

### Learning Objectives

- To walk through data life cycle steps with an introduction to tools relevant to life sciences research, including in a context of computational analysis for life sciences.
- To understand FAIR principles in the context of each data cycle step
- To understand the data curation processes that enable data reuse and repurposing
- To know the different RDM guidelines and practices used by the various RIs and institutions in Norway. 

### Learning Outcomes:

- To be able to define and connect RDM tasks within a domain of interest.
- To be able to determine different tools that are available, globally and in Norway, to carry out RDM tasks.  
- To be able to identify metadata standards and to associate relevant deposition repositories
- To be able to analyse and evaluate FAIRness of Data (and Management Plan)

### Learning Activities:

Each session will include time for a short discussion including questions and answers. We plan to have a group activity on last day of the course that will involve reviewing and discussing how to create a FAIR DMP. In addition, we plan to include a short quiz relevant to each session; learners are recommended to take a quiz during or after the course to help revise and understand the content learned throughout the course.

### Target Audience

The target audience includes masterâ€™s students, PhD candidates, postdoctoral fellows, early-career researchers, and technical staff involved in scientific research in the life sciences in Norway. The course is particularly relevant for users and/or collaborators of the research infrastructures listed below:

- NorSeq The national consortium for sequencing and personalised medicine
- NOR-Openscreen The consortium for chemical biology and early drug discovery
- NORMOLIM The Norwegian Molecular Imaging Infrastructure
- NALMIN The Norwegian Advanced Light Microscopy Imaging Network 
- NORCRYST The Norwegian Macromolecular Crystallography Consortium 
- BBMRI-NO The national RI for clinical and population-based biobanks
- MoBa Genetics The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study
- GBIF Norway The Norwegian node of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
